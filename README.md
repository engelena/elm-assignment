## Assignments
This project contains a small Elm project. Run the `elm reactor` command and open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You should see a series of assignments being tested. Your goal is to make all the tests pass.

For each assignment there is a Elm module. Those modules can be found in the `src/Assignment/` directory. For example, assignment one can be found at `src/Assignment/One.elm`
